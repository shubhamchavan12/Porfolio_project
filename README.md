Being a data analyst the best and fastest way to learn skills is by doing personal projects. I have uploaded my personal projects
 
 - *Sample  Super  store  Data  Analysis*
 
- *My 1st project is for Sample SuperStore Data anaalysis. In this project i Worked on a 'Retail Superstore' dataset which included region and category-wise sales and profit for the United States.*

- *As per the visualization total sales were 2.30M with the highest sales 37.8% of total sales in the technology sector.*
- *It was found that sub-category wise profit for copiers seems to be highest with 19.6% of total profit.*
